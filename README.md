# Excitement
Android Wear and Handheld communicate to tweet your excitement! 

<h3> The way this app works: </h3>
When you get excited, you tend to raise your arms or pump your fists right? Well what if you had a smart watch that could sense this motion and allow you to capture and tweet it simultaneously? Excitement is an app that uses the smartwatch's accelerometer to sense you're giddy. It then vibrates and pops up a notification asking if you are excited. If you swipe right and select yes, it'll open up the camera on your phone. Once you capture an image on the phone, it will automatically open your twitter, place that image in twitter, along with a #cs160excited message (you can add extra text as well), and allow you to instantly tweet your excitement to the world. <br>
